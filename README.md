# IdentityServerApp
Test application using Identity Server 4 and docker.
All configuration for Identity Server 4 is done in memory for now.

There are 3 different projects on this repo, the Identity Server itself, an API which uses Identity Server as the Authentication Authority and a client that consumes the API and therefore needs to get a token from Identity Server.
